Paul,
Sorry this disk has been so long coming, but i've been busy. To slice programs 
over several disks, you need to use SLICE.COM, on this disk. It will 
automatically create Splice on the first disk, to rebuild the files.
Since I've now finished at ITEM, I can't be contacted there anymore. However,
if you need help, software, or have any good games, you can contact me at:
	Ian Cornish
	10, Victoria Road
	Sheffield
	S10 2DL

	Tel : 0742 684123, after 6pm Weekdays, after 11 am Weekends.

Also on this disk are is a game (Revenge Of DOH - Breakout), and maybe a few
other things I thought you may like.

Best Wishes

Ian.
