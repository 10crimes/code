
Push and pull path
By Paul Clark (C)Dec 1992

These two programs work together to enable the user to store their path along the tree and recall it at a later date.  Push stores the path, pull restores it.

The files necessary for these programs to work are:
        
        PUSH.BAT                        PULL.BAT
        PATH.TXT (this file)            CD.PNC

The last file must be in a directory which can be found in the environment variable TOOLS.  This means that if CD.PNC was in the directory C:\UTILS, then an addition of the following line must be made to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

        SET TOOLS=C:\UTILS

The push and pull files will not operate without this.  Perhaps if my programming skills improve I may be able to get around this obstacle, but at the moment this is the best solution I can find.
