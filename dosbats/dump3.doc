                   Program to Search, Examine, and Modify Any File


          INTRODUCTION
          
          
          
          DUMP allows you to examine the contents of a file.  You can also 
          search for data within a file, as well as modify the file's con- 
          tents.
          
          Why  can't  you just TYPE the file?  Well,  to an extent you can.  
          TYPE will show you what is  in  the  file.  What  it  shows  you, 
          however,  is  often  unreadable to the human eye.  Files that are 
          compressed and files that contain non-ASCII data will look like a 
          stream of random characters.  And,  of course,  you can't  modify 
          that stream of random characters, just look at it.  Not very use- 
          ful.  
          
          What about text processors?  Can they do the job?  After all, you 
          can modify files with a text processor, can't you?  Yes, you can.  
          Again,  however,  you are often faced with a stream of characters 
          that make no sense to you.  Trying to  decipher  a  file  is  not 
          always easy.  Besides,  isn't that what computers are supposed to 
          do for you?  
          
          Here comes DUMP to the rescue!  Not only will DUMP allow  you  to 
          search  through the data,  not only will DUMP allow you to EASILY 
          modify a file,  but DUMP will also present the data to you in  an 
          easy-to-understand display.  In fact,  it will display the infor- 
          mation two different ways,  so you can attack the data YOUR  way, 
          not just the way somebody else thought you should do so.  
          
          Have  you  ever had a file corrupted?  Don't worry!  DUMP can fix 
          it almost instantly.  Program not working right and  you  suspect 
          the file has wrong data?  Relax!  DUMP will show you exactly what 
          data is in your file.  No more guesswork.  
          
          DUMP is  easy to use and will prove itself invaluable as you work
          with your computer.  





          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          HOW TO USE DUMP

          
          
          Format:   DUMP [d:]filename[.ext][ O=offset][ S=search][ EOF]
          
          Type:     Internal  External
                                ****
          
          Remarks:  Specify the parameters:
                      
                    [d:]filename[.ext] to specify the file  to  be  DUMPed.  
                    The  drive  specification  [d:]  is optional.  The ext- 
                    ension [.ext] is optional,  but if the file has an ext- 
                    ension,  you  must include it when you call DUMP.  DUMP 
                    does not assume a specific extension.  
                    
                    [ O=offset] to specify the byte offset  into  the  file 
                    where  DUMP is to begin.  If O= is not specified,  DUMP 
                    starts from the beginning of the file.  offset can be a 
                    number  from 0 up to the size of the file in bytes.  If 
                    offset is not a multiple of 256,  it  will  be  rounded 
                    down to the nearest multiple of 256.  
                    
                    [ S=search]  to  have  DUMP  search  for  the specified 
                    string.  When the first occurence of that string in the 
                    file is found,  DUMP stops searching and  displays  the 
                    file  contents  at that point.  If S= is not specified, 
                    DUMP will not search for a  particular  string.  search 
                    can  be any string that does NOT contain a space.  DUMP 
                    assumes that the first space  it  encounters  after  S= 
                    marks the end of the search string.  
                    
                    [ EOF]  to  have  DUMP jump to the end of  the file and 
                    display the file  contents  at  that  point.  EOF  will 
                    override both O= and S=.  

          Example:  The following example DUMPs the file TEST.DAT on drive 
                    B.
                    
                    A>dump b:test.dat
                    
                    The following example DUMPs the file MYPROG.BAS  start- 
                    ing with byte 2560.  
                    
                    A>dump myprog.bas o=2560
                    
                    The following example DUMPs the file DATA starting with 
                    byte 1280 and searching for the first occurrence of the 
                    string "filename".  
                    
                    A>dump data o=1280 s=filename
                    
                    The  following  example DUMPs the last part of the file 
                    RANDOM.TXT.  
                    
                    A>dump random.txt eof

          DISPLAY FORMAT
                    
          When  DUMP  displays the file's contents,  it does so in two dif- 
          ferent formats:  HEX and ASCII.  Each line on the screen displays 
          16  bytes  from  the  file.  There  are 16 lines displayed on the 
          screen at once, for a total of 256 bytes on each screen.  
          
          To make the screen easier to read,  the 16 lines are broken  into 
          two  groups  of 8 lines.  Each line is divided into two groups of 
          eight bytes.  On the HEX part of the screen,  the groups are div- 
          ided  by a dot.  On the ASCII part of the screen,  the groups are 
          divided by a double line at the top and bottom of the screen.  
          
          On the left side of the screen is a  column  marked  OFFSET.  The 
          offset  numbers  tell  how  far  DUMP is into the file.  Thus the 
          first line has an offset number of 0 because at the beginning  of 
          that line,  there are 0 bytes that came before it.  The next line 
          has an offset of 16 bytes because at the beginning of  that  line 
          16  bytes have already been DUMPed (the first line).  At the beg- 
          inning of the third line,  32  bytes  have  been  DUMPed  already 
          (lines  one and two),  etc.  Each screen shows 256 bytes,  so the 
          first offset number on a screen is a multiple of 256.  
          
          The HEX part of the screen shows the file bytes in hex format (00 
          to FF).  The ASCII part of the screen shows the ASCII  equivalent 
          of  each  HEX byte.  The only exceptions are ASCII characters 0 - 
          31.  These are represented on the screen by a period since  their 
          meanings  are  not clear visually.  However,  the HEX part of the 
          screen tells you exactly which characters are being displayed, so 
          you can always tell what it is.  
          



























          HOW TO USE DUMP (Continued)



          ACTIVE KEYS
          
          Once DUMP is started, there are several keys you can use:
          
          
                 HOME             SPACE             END
                 UP ARROW         ESC               DOWN ARROW
                 PG UP            INS               PG DOWN
          
          HOME will cause DUMP to display the beginning of the  file.  This 
          is a fast way to return to the beginning.  
          
          UP ARROW  will  cause  DUMP  to display the previous screen  (the 
          previous 256 bytes).  
          
          PG UP will cause DUMP to jump back 5 screens (1280 bytes).
          
          END will cause DUMP to display the end of the  file.  This  is  a 
          fast way to jump to the end.  
          
          DOWN ARROW  will  cause DUMP to display the next screen (the next 
          256 bytes).  
          
          PG DOWN will cause DUMP to jump forward 5 screens (1280 bytes).
          
          SPACE will start DUMP scrolling through  the  file  at  a  steady 
          speed.  To  stop  the  scrolling,  hit the space bar again.  Once 
          scrolling begins, the only keys that are active besides the space 
          bar  are the numeral keys  1 - 9.  These cause the  scrolling  to 
          speed  up  or  slow down with 1 being the slowest and 9 being the 
          fastest.  The current speed is displayed at  the  bottom  of  the 
          screen.  
          
          Please  note  that  the preceding keys are only active at certain 
          times.  Thus if you are at the beginning of the file, UP ARROW or 
          HOME or PG UP will not go any farther.  Similarly,  if you are at 
          the end of the file,  DOWN ARROW,  END, and PG DOWN will take you 
          no farther.  When a key is not currently active,  the key message 
          will  disappear from the screen and hitting that key will have no 
          effect.  
          
          In addition, the RIGHT ARROW and LEFT ARROW keys can also be used 
          if  you  started  DUMP  with the S= option.  S= will show you the 
          first occurrence of the search string.  Hitting the  RIGHT  ARROW 
          key will show you the next occurrence,  if any.  Hitting the LEFT 
          ARROW key will show you the previous occurrence,  if  any.  These 
          keys  can  be used repeatedly until you come to the end or begin- 
          ning of the file.  However,  if you did not specify  S=,  neither 
          the RIGHT ARROW or LEFT ARROW key will have any effect.  
          
          ESC will exit from DUMP at any time except when scrolling or when 
          in MODIFY mode (see below).  




          HOW TO USE DUMP (Continued) 
          
          
          
          MODIFY MODE
          
          INS will cause DUMP to enter MODIFY mode.  The screen will change 
          slightly as follows:  The only special keys that will  be  active 
          are INS (to leave MODIFY mode) and F9 (to write any modifications 
          to the file in order to permanently save them).  In addition, the 
          cursor  will  appear  as  a  large blinking box in the upper left 
          corner of the HEX part of the screen.  
          
          In MODIFY mode,  you can overwrite any of the 256  bytes  on  the 
          screen by typing over them.  You can do this either by typing the 
          hex codes if you are in the HEX part of the screen,  or by typing 
          the ASCII characters if you are in the ASCII part of the  screen.  
          To  move  from  one part of the screen to the other,  hit the TAB 
          key.  
          
          As you begin typing, your modifications will appear on the screen 
          highlighted.  This means that  your  modifications  are  not  yet 
          being saved to the file itself.  To do this, hit F9.  Any changes 
          you made will now be permanently stored  in  the  file  and  your 
          changes  will  no longer appear highlighted.  If you leave MODIFY 
          mode before you hit F9,  the changes will not be  saved  and  the 
          screen will be restored to the previous values.  

          When you are finished making modifications, hit F9 to save the 
          changes (if you want them saved) and hit the INS key to return to 
          normal DUMP mode.  You can then DUMP the next screen, hit INS to 
          enter MODIFY mode and modify the next screen, if you want.
