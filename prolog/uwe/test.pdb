factorial(0,1):- !.
factorial(N,X):-
	M is N-1,
	factorial(M,Y),
	X is Y*N.
	% !.

% We need one of these cuts or it will look for alternatives to factorial(0,N) in the -ves!

% However sum does not have this problem, because sum([],0) cannot be reattempted because the other definition requires a splittable list.

sum([],0).
% or equivalently
% sum(L,N):- L == [], N is 0.
sum([X|Xs],N):-
	sum(Xs,M),
	N is (M + X).
