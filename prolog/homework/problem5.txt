
Problem 5 (Date Given: Nov 11, Deadline: Nov 18)
---------

Write a program to solve the travelling salesman problem

	best_route(Start, ListPlaces, route(R,D)) 
where 

(1) R is the shortest route from Start via ListPlaces and back to Start;
(2) D is the total distance of the route R.

You can use the data we have used in assignment 2 (i.e. the 
facts on distances between pairs of places), then test

?- best_route(bristol, [exeter, bath, salisbury], R).

Alternatively, you can use the data I gave in lecture 10,
that is

distance(p1, p2, 3).
distance(p1, p3, 4).
distance(p1, p4, 25).
distance(p2, p3, 20).
distance(p2, p4, 5).
distance(p3, p4, 6).

and test
 
?- best_route(p1, [p2,p3,p4], R).

Please try to use the branch-and-bound method discussed during lecture 10.
Any answer based on the naive method given in lecture 10's handout will be 
marked down.

Please also try to document your program as detail as you can. The
documentation will be worth 1 mark in this final assignment. 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Send in your program and the script by the deadline.
