Problem 4 (Date Given: Oct 31, Deadline: Nov 8)
---------

Please copy the file "jobs.pl" before you start this assignment.

The file jobs.pl contains information about three technicians and 
a list of jobs which need to be assigned to these three technicians.

(1). Given a list of jobs L and a technician T, please write a
     program

	jobs_assign(T, L, JobsForT, RestJobs)

     which selects four jobs from L for technician T and
     returns unselected jobs. In case of having less than four jobs 
     available for T, we should select as many jobs as possible.

     A list of jobs and the relation "can_do" are defined in 
     "jobs.pl". Note that a job in the job list is represented as
     a structure

         j(JobLocation, JobType).

(2). Assume we use the above structure for a job, write a program 
     
         get_job_location(JobList, LocationList)

     which extracts all locations from JobList and removes duplicated
     locations (if any). For example,
  
      ?- get_job_location([j(bristol,   j_type1),
               		   j(bristol,   j_type2),
               		   j(bristol,   j_type2),
                           j(exeter,    j_type3) ], L).

     should have a solution L = [bristol, exeter] (or [exeter, bristol]).
     (In Bratko's book page 132, there is an example on how to add
      element to a list without duplication)

Please test your program by using 

?- go1.

and

?- go2.

which are defined in "jobs.pl".

A very simple program print_result/3 is provided in "jobs.pl" to 
print out the results.

Please send in your program and the script by the deadline.
