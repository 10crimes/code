\section{Determining the Format  of Paragraphs} \label{sec-parags}

The location of the horizontal vanishing point, and the projection profile of
the text from that position, make it possible to separate the individual lines
of text.  This will allow the style of formatting or justification of the
paragraphs to be determined, and lead to the location of the vertical vanishing
point as shall be described in \refsect{sec-vertvanish}.

We apply a simple algorithm to the winning projection profile to segment the
lines.  A {\em peak} is defined to be any range of angles over which all the
projection profile's bins register more than $K$ pixels, with $K$ as the
average height of the interesting part of the projection profile:

\begin{equation}
K= \frac{1}{y-x+1} \sum_{i=x}^{y}B_i
\end{equation}

{\parindent 0mm
where $x$ and $y$ are the indices of the first and last non-empty bins respectively.
A {\em trough} is defined to be the range of angles between one peak and the next.  
The central angle of each trough is used to indicate the separating boundary of
two adjacent lines in the paragraph.  We project segmenting lines from the
vanishing point through each of these central angles.
% in the range.
All pixels in the binary image lying between two adjacent segmenting
lines are collected together as one line of text. Example results of this
segmentation are shown in \reffig{linesegfig}.
% Most lines of text are segmented accurately, although in
% \reffig{chem002overlay} a very short line has been ignored.
Noisy pixels, very short lines, and extraneous document
elements may become attached to a true text line, or be segmented as a separate
line.  However, the processing which follows will compensate for this irrelevant
data.

Depending on the formatting of the paragraph being recovered, there are now two
possible ways to analyse the segmented lines to reveal the vertical vanishing
point.  If the paragraph is {\em fully-justified}, then the left and right
margins of the text are straight, and intersecting these two margin lines will
provide us with the vertical vanishing point, and the problem is fully resolved.

Alternatively, if the paragraph is {\em left-justified}, {\em right-justified},
or {\em centred}, a straight line will be visible either on the left margin, on
the right margin, or through the centres of the lines, respectively.  The
vanishing point will lie somewhere along this {\em baseline} (see Figure \ref{linesegfig}).  However, its actual
position will still be unknown, and must be estimated.  Initially, we must
determine the structure of the paragraph, i.e. its formatting style and its baseline. We collect
the left end, the centroid, and the right end of each of the segmented paragraph lines, to
form three sets of points $P_L,P_C,P_R$ respectively.  Since some justification
or formatting is anticipated in the text document, 
we will expect a straight line to
fit well through at least one of these sets of points, representing the left or
right margin, or the centre line of the text.  To establish the line of
best fit for each set of points, we use a RANSAC (random sampling consensus,
\cite{bolles81ransac-based}) algorithm to reject outliers caused for example by
short lines, equations or headings.  Given a set of points $P$, the line of best
fit through a potential fit $F=\{\myvec{p}_i, i=1,..,M\}\subseteq P$ passes
through $\myvec{c}$, the average of the points, at an angle $\psi$ found by
minimising the following error function:

\begin{equation}
% E_F(\myvec{c},\myvec{n}) = \frac{1}{M^5} \sum_{i=1}^{M} ( (\myvec{p}_i-\myvec{c}) \cdot \myvec{n})^2
E_F(\psi) = \frac{1}{M^5} \sum_{i=1}^{M} ( (\myvec{p}_i-\myvec{c}) \cdot \myvec{n})^2
\label{ransacerroreqn}
\end{equation}

{\parindent 0mm
where $\myvec{n}=(-\sin \psi,\cos \psi)$ is the normal to the line, $M^{2}$
normalises the sum, and a further $M^{3}$ rewards the fit for using a large
number of points. Hence, for the three sets of points $P_L,P_C,P_R$ we obtain
three lines of best fit $F_L,F_C,F_R$ with respective errors
$E_L,E_C,E_R$.  It is now possible to classify the formatting style of the
paragraph using the rules in \reftab{typeofparatable}.
\reffig{chem002overlay} shows the line $F_L$ passing through the left margin of
the paragraph.  In this case $E_L<E_C$ and $E_L<E_R$, hence the second
condition in \reftab{typeofparatable} is satisfied and the paragraph is
correctly identified as being left-justified. The examples in 
\reffig{chem015overlay} show the detection of centrally-justified paragraphs
in a book of poems.

As mentioned earlier, for fully-justified paragraphs, the recovery of the
vertical vanishing point is trivial. This may be achieved by intersecting the
left and right margins of the paragraphs, e.g. $F_L$ and $F_R$, the results of 
which are shown later in \reftab{accuracytable} and \reffig{vvpaccuracya}. 
However, for a left-justified, right-justified or centralised paragraph, we can
retrieve only one baseline.  The other two fitted lines will have significant
errors due to the jagged margin(s).  In these situations, a different method
must be used to determine the position on the baseline at which the vanishing
point lies.
