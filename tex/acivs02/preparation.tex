\section{Preparation}
\label{prepandprobdef}




In the next section we analyse this binary data to find the separate
lines of text.
Analysis of the lines will reveal the type of paragraph (left-, right-, fully-
or centrally-justified) and allow estimation of the position of
the vertical vanishing point.
From the vanishing points we form a quadrilateral frame surrounding the
text on the plane, which is used in
\refsect{remper} to recover a
fronto-parallel view suitable for optical character recognition.
We conclude in \refsect{conclusions}.
