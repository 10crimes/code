<joepie91> joeytwiddle: honestly, my advice would be "just use Bluebird":
<joepie91> which generally just does the right thing out of the box in terms of debugging and error handling
<joeytwiddle> good to hear from someone experienced.  we're using Q at the moment
<joepie91> ES6 promises are currently just not very good :)
<joepie91> you definitely want to move away from Q, heh
<joepie91> that's just an outright trashfire
<joepie91> (but understandable given its goals)
<joepie91> it's obscenely slow, the API is nigh unusable
<joepie91> and I mean, it was meant as an experimental implementation so I'm not blaming it for that
<joeytwiddle> i haven't been using it, in case i want to switch later ;)
<joepie91> but it means that you should probably not be using it in your code
<joeytwiddle> (the API i mean)
<joepie91> :P
<joepie91> joeytwiddle: mmye, my advice remains "just use Bluebird", including the APIs it offers :P
