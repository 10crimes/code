Some JS newbie was trying to pass a function around, but with arguments
applied:

setTimeout( moveit(id,newxpos,timetotake), 1000 );

which of course you can't do.  Normally I would solve this with a function
wrapper.

setTimeout( function(){ moveit(id,newxpos,timetotake); }, 1000 );

But alternatively, we can just convert the function call into a partial
application, by adding ".bind(null,":

setTimeout( moveit.bind(null,id,newxpos,timetotake), 1000 );

So that is what they mean when they say bind is a partial application.

In fact it sort of represents a level above .call, in that:

  myFunc.call(null, arg1, arg2);

  // could be written

  myFunc.bind(null, arg1, arg2)();
