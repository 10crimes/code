* substack uses hundreds of modules written for node and published to npm directly in the browser without modification with browserify
<dr0id> is moot*
<dr0id> browserify is nice but ...
<Jan-> okay, let's look at this in terms of my actual code
<riven> Let's not.
<Jan-> I have one object, Basic 3D (it does 3D mesh manipulation and suchlike).
<Jan-> It is represented by one global singleton (well, USUALLY it is), called b3d.
<riven> No really, let's not.
* Sorella is trying to catch up with SubStack on number of npm modules published. But I don't think I can achieve that anyways =/
<Jan-> I have like eight or so files that add b3d.Mesh, b3d.Vert, etc, onto it.
<hughfdjackson> Sorella: one module per function
<hughfdjackson> gogogo
<Jan-> How does node deal with that?
<substack> Sorella: npm install -g npmtop
<Sorella> haha
<dr0id> hughfdjackson: :P
<substack> Sorella: that's a good way to keep score
<FireFly> Jan-, let mesh.js export the stuff that you'd put in b3d.Mesh
<FireFly> Jan-, have b3d.js (or index.js or whatever) export a b3d object, and do b3d.Mesh = require('./mesh')
<FireFly> or something
<Sorella> >143
<FireFly> That's how I'd do it
<Sorella> O_o

<hughfdjackson> FireFly: and i
<hughfdjackson> <3 so purdy
* FireFly wonders if that 'O_o' was for me or for substack's module count
<hughfdjackson> so lovely
<hughfdjackson> mmmMmM

<substack> hughfdjackson: yeah pretty much, once you get into the flow of it
<substack> everybody here has written over 143 functions
<substack> I just put them on npm when I write them
<substack> because then I won't need to copy/paste them around later
<Munter> yup
<Munter> It's a nice workflow

<dr0id> lets all do that and eat up github's space :3
<Munter> Isn't everybody already?
<FireFly> substack, and one of those modules is npmtop itself
<Munter> I see npm modules fly around everywhere :P
<dr0id> heh :P
<dr0id> npm install -g joke

Jul 01 17:22:33 <ImBcmDth>	Jan-: ok I have a project that used to have each object add itself to a global namespace so you ended up with things like "new MyNamespace.Vector" all over the place. In converting it to node's module-style, I discovered that the modules that needed vectors simply require(Vector) directly. No more namespace! Now everything that needs Vector just uses "new Vector" much cleaner.
Jul 01 17:22:34 <Sorella>	Well, I'm done discussing things with wierd troll-ish people. Time to work on useful stuff.
Jul 01 17:22:36 <ImBcmDth>	Jan-: To make the *external* interface the same, I simply make one file called "MyNamespace" that imports everything and constructs a namespace-like object. So external code still just require(MyNamespace) and can then do "new MyNamespace.Vector".
