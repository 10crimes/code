11:00 < joeytwiddle_> also, have you ever thought it would be nice if scope was an object you could grab hold of and pass around?  (or more accurately the scope-chain)
11:01 < joeytwiddle_> conversely, we might be able to put objects into the scope-chain if we wanted.  (eat that with-statement!)
11:02 < joeytwiddle_> since JS made functions first-order, this would go a little further and give us horrible amounts of control :P

11:14 < ckknight> joeytwiddle_: I kind of like that the scope isn't as malleable as that. It would completely destroy 
                  static lexical scoping and would cause us the same issues as the old LISP dynamic bindings used to, 
                  especially since the hygiene of any scope could be called into question.

11:19 < joeytwiddle_> You're right, writing to scope might not be pretty.  But reading it could be pretty harmless.
