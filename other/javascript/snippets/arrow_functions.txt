the "this" value in an arrow function depends on how its containing function is invoked at runtime, not at definition time.
the environment record simply doesn't shadow "this"
regular functions *always* bind a "this" based on how they're invoked. arrow functions simply don't bind a "this" at all.
<Deide> It just uses `this` as it would any other variable in the enclosing scope. Easy to think about it that way.
<Sorella> With the difference that regular functions *also* introduce a `this` name.
<ljharb> also `super` and `arguments`
