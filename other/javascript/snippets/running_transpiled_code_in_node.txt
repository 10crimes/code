<joeytwiddle> Is it possible to transpile-and-run a node app all in one command? e.g. instead of `node app.js` i would run `transpile-then-node app.js` to run on older versions of Node
<danneu> joeytwiddle: for example, babel can transform at runtime
<GreenJello> joeytwiddle, install babel-cli and then it's babe-node app.js
<preaction> npm scripts are things too
<joeytwiddle> thanks you!
<GreenJello> you'll also have to configure babel https://brigand.github.io/config-wizard/?babelrc
<danneu> that's also what ts-node does for typescript code, or coffee's executable for coffeescript code
<sillyslux> i use "nodemon foo.js --exec babel-node --inspect" occasionly
<GreenJello> choose node.js app on the second question
