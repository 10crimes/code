So you thought ES6 arrow functions would make your Javascript code smaller?  Think again!

Of course, arrow functions do reduce code length when we are creating anonymous functions:

```
// ES5
var newItems = items.map(function(x){ return x*2; });

// ES6
var newItems = items.map(x => x*2);
```

But now some ES6 gurus are recommending using arrow functions in other situations, because they have "clearer semantics":

```
// ES5
function counter (state, action) {
  return state;
}

// ES6
const counter = (state, action) => {
  return state;
};
```

So if you follow the advice of these gurus, ES6 will make your Javascript code longer!
