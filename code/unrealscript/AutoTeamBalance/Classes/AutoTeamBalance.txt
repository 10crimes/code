AutoTeamBalance performs team balancing with three different algorithms:

	1) At the beginning of the game, all players are balanced
	(ForceFullTeamsRebalance)

	2) When a new player joins mid-game, he is assigned to the weaker team
	(ModifyLogin)

	3) When a player or admin requests MidGameTeamBalance, either the
	1-player-switch or 2-player-switch rebalance algorithm will be called,
	depending on the difference in the player count of the two teams.  Or
	admins may ForceFullTeamsRebalance as in event 1.

Players may request teambalancing during the game, by saying "teams" or
"!teams", but only if bLetPlayersRebalance is set to True in the config.

Commands available to players:

  Say "!teams" or "teams" to request MidGameTeamBalance.

  Say "!red" or "!blue" to get auto-switched to that team.

The Administrator and semi-admins can type the following commands in the
console.  (You may wish to empty the admin password in the config file, so that
all players can be semi-admins.)

	mutate help

	mutate teams [password]

		will switch one player to the other team, or will swap two players.
		The same as saying "teams" when bLetPlayersRebalance is set in the
		config.  Refuses to balance again for MinSecondsBeforeRebalance.

	mutate forceteams [password]

		the same as the teambalance which occurs at the beginning of the map,
		if bAutoBalanceTeamsForCTF is set, and this is a CTF game.
		May switch a lot of players, including players holding the flag!

	mutate tored <player_name> [password]

		moves the player to the red team
		player_name may be only a part of the player's nick

	mutate toblue <player_name> [password]

		moves the player to the blue team

	mutate warn <player_name> <message> [password]

		flashes the message/warning on the player's screen, and shakes his view

	mutate kick <player_name> <message> [password]

		flashes the message/warning on the player's screen, then kicks him from
		the server

The following commands are only available to the Server Admin when he is logged in:

	mutate saveconfig [password]

		updates the stats and saves everthing to the config file
		if the game ends after this then the this time period will be counted again

	mutate get <package> <var_name>

		will display the gameengine's current value of the config variable

	mutate set <package> <var_name> <new_value>
	mutate getprop <var_name>
	mutate setprop <var_name> <new_value>
	mutate console <command>
