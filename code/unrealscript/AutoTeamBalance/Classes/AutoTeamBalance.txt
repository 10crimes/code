We perform three different balancing algorithms, based on three different game events:

  1) At the beginning of the game, all players are balanced

  2) When a new player joins mid-game, he is assigned to the weaker team

  3) When a player or admin requests mid-game teambalance, either the
     1-player-switch or 2-player-switch rebalance algorithm will be called,
     depending on the difference in the player count of the two teams.
     Or admins may force a full teams rebalance like event 1.

Players may request teambalancing during the game, by saying "teams" or "!teams", but only if bLetPlayersRebalance is set to True in the config.

The Administrator and semi-admins can type the following commands in the console.  (You may wish to empty the admin password in the config file, so that all players can be semi-admins.)

  mutate teams [password]

    will switch one player to the other team, or will swap two players.
    The same as saying "teams" when bLetPlayersRebalance is set in the config.
    Refuses to balance again for MinSecondsBeforeRebalance.

  mutate forceteams [password]

    the same as the teambalance which occurs at the beginning of the map, if
    bAutoBalanceTeamsForCTF is set, and this is a CTF game.
    May switch a lot of players, including players holding the flag!

  mutate tored <player_name> [password]

    moves the player to the red team
    player_name may be only a part of the player's nick

  mutate toblue <player_name> [password]

    moves the player to the blue team

  mutate warn <player_name> <message> [password]

    flashes the message/warning on the player's screen, and shakes his view

  mutate saveconfig [password]

    updates the stats and saves everthing to the config file
    if the game ends after this then the this time period will be counted again

The following commands are only available to the Server Admin when he is logged in:

  mutate get <package> <var_name>
    will display the gameengine's current value of the config variable
  mutate getprop <var_name>
  mutate setprop <var_name> <new_value>
  mutate set <package> <var_name> <new_value>
  mutate console <command>
