Many great CTF maps are unsuitable for siege simply because their flagspot is
too exposed, so the base core can be easily spammed to death.

The ActorEditor mutator allows us to set new positions for FlagBase0.Location
and FlagBase1.Location, so you can hide the base core in a more appropriate
position on the map.



Where is a good place to put the core?

Hard to reach.  This usually means somewhere deep in the base, so enemies must
be passed to reach it.  Height is always an advantage, but not out of reach!

Not too exposed.  Think about the amount of floor space available to someone
who wants to hit your core.  If there is a wide area from which people can see
your core, they will run around in that space spamming.  (Avoid Thorns4way!)

But don't make it *impossible* for players to reach the enemy core.  Leave them
some floor space when they do reach the core.  Give them one or two vaguely
passable routes to the enemy flagroom.  (Avoid HillForts or Niven.)



HOW TO MOVE THE BASE CORES using ActorEditor

I do this as a spectator.  It might be easier to work in CTF mode, so you can
see the flag moving.  Otherwise follow the instructions closely!

Install the ActorEditor mutator, and configure it to run in Siege games.

Join the server, and log in as admin.

Find the first core you want to move:

> mutate seek flagbase0

Read its team number if you like:

> mutate check team

Now focus ActorEditor on yourself:

> mutate seek chspec

(The camera may jump backwards, as you attempt to look at yourself!)

Move to exactly where you want the base core to be.  Then read your position:

> mutate check location

Now focus back on the flag marker, and input the location you just saw:

> mutate seek flagbase0

> mutate store location 500,-600,320

Be careful to read the little -s!

You can check to see if the actor went to the right place by refocusing:

> mutate seek flagbase0

Once you are happy, repeat the process for the other core:

> mutate seek flagbase1
...

If you are happy with what you did, save to ActorEditor.ini with:

> mutate saveall

That is all.  Restart the map to check the cores load up in the new locations!





Notes:

You can try moving BaseCore0 instead of FlagBase0, but it won't work!  You will
see the glow move (maybe useful), but the mesh will not move, and your new
location will be IGNORED when the map restarts.  We must set FlagBase
positions, since they are the markers from which BaseCores are spawned.

If your server runs CTF and Siege modes, the flags will move in both games!  If
you don't want that to happen, configure your server/mapvote to only run the
ActorEditor mutator during Siege matches, and not for CTF games.
