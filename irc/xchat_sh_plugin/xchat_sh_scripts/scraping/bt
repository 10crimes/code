## Only catches BT servers in the top page (so only if BT servers are more full than other servers):
# SEARCH="\(BT\|CTF-BT\)-" sh ./scraping/scrapegt "$@"

## Should catch more:
(
	bash ./scraping/searchserv BT
	bash ./scraping/searchserv Bunny
) | grep "\(BT\|CTF-BT\)-" | removeduplicatelines

sleep 5
(
echo "/me was crushed/burnt/slimed/frozen/drowned/depressurised/beheaded again"
echo "/me was incinerated"
echo "/me was slimed"
echo "/me left a small crater"
echo "/me killed his own dumb self"
