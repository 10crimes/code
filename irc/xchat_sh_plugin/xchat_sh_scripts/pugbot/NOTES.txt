A sensible bot would have two levels of commands: normal users can join/leave/captain, ops can change settings (if it doesn't break the pug).

But actually what I want utb0t to do is: normal users can do anything if it doesn't break the pug, ops can do anything including breaking the pug!

To be truly smart, utb0t would allow Either Style of Working.

e.g. IS_PRIVILEGED_TO_USE_PUGBOT_POWER_COMMANDS could be set during startup, if the current style means this user has all the pugbot powers.
