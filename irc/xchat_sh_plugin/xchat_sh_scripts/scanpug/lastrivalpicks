## BUG: Rival does not list blue's last pick on a line with ~> but it does list red's!
## Get indivual players as they were picked:

## This is useless anyway, unless we actually have the auths of the puggers.

## Get the last !last:
# grep ".*<Rival>.*..*,.*,.*,.*,.*,.*,.*,.*,.*,.*..*" /home/joey/.xchat2.utb0t/logs/irc.quakenet.org-#ut.pug.log | tail -n 1
