## BUG: Rival does not list blue's last pick on a line with ~> but it does list red's!
## Get indivual players as they were picked:
# grep "~>" /home/joey/.xchat2.utb0t/logs/irc.quakenet.org-#ut.pug.log | tail -n 6
## This is useless anyway, unless we actually have the auths of the puggers.

## Get the last !last:
# grep ".*<Rival>.*..*,.*,.*,.*,.*,.*,.*,.*,.*,.*..*" /home/joey/.xchat2.utb0t/logs/irc.quakenet.org-#ut.pug.log | tail -n 1

# alias double_escape_slashes=" sed 's+\\\\+\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\+g' "
alias double_escape_slashes=" sed 's+\\\\+\\\\\\\\+g' "

[ "$CHANNEL" = "" ] && CHANNEL="#ut.pug"

## Get last two filled teams lines:
LASTLINES=`
tail -n 4000 "/home/joey/.xchat2.utb0t/logs/irc.quakenet.org-$CHANNEL.log" |
# grep ".*<Rival>.*?.*,.*,.*,.*,.*?.*" | grep -v " ago " | grep -v " Specs: " | tail -n 2
grep "<\(Rival\|RF\)>" | grep -B2 " Pickup Over " | tail -n 3 | chop 1 |
afterfirst "<[^>]*> *[^ ]* " |
tr -d '‡'
`

## Unfortunately ABot does not print the final teams until !last is requested.
# LASTLINESABOT=`
# cat "/home/joey/.xchat2.utb0t/logs/irc.quakenet.org-$CHANNEL.log" |
# grep "<\(APug\|ABot\)>" | grep -A1 " Teams have been set " | tail -n 1
