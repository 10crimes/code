#### You idiot!
#### You could have just looked for line "New Score: Red Team 0:4 Blue Team"

## Find the last time scores were published:
DATA=` grep -A3 "\] \*\* Current Score:" "$LOGFILE" | tail -n 4 `

## Extract the scores at that time:
REDSCORE=` echo "$DATA" | grep "Red Team" | afterfirst "Team" | takecols 2 `
BLUESCORE=` echo "$DATA" | grep "Blue Team" | afterfirst "Team" | takecols 2 `

## Now find any caps since then:

## Should have worked but did not:
# TOPLINERE=` echo "$DATA" | head -n 1 | toregexp `
# UPDATES=` cat "$LOGFILE" | fromline "^$TOPLINERE$" `

TOPLINERE=` echo "$DATA" | head -n 1 | takecols 1 2 3 | toregexp `
UPDATES=` cat "$LOGFILE" | fromline "^$TOPLINERE" `

REDDELTA=` echo "$UPDATES" | grep "The red team scores\!$" | wc -l `
BLUEDELTA=` echo "$UPDATES" | grep "The blue team scores\!$" | wc -l `

REDSCORE=$((REDSCORE+REDDELTA))
BLUESCORE=$((BLUESCORE+BLUEDELTA))
