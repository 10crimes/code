You are recommended to follow the following procedure to obtain a working copy of my research code.

Visit http://hwi.ath.cx/twiki/bin/view/Neuralyte/ProjectJsh and install and run the jsh environment.

In jsh, type:

	cd $JPATH/code
	hwicvs co c/phd c/joeylib
	makephdbins

If all goes well, you will have compiled all the executables I used for testing.

The C code used to work under Solaris, but although it still compiles, I believe there are numerical problems somewhere which cause some part of the process to completely fail (texture measures I think).  So do compile and run on Linux, and if you must move to Solaris, observe the difference in the programs' output!

Running the programs may be a little harder!  I used to have some test images in the images/ directory, and I ran 0allall to batch process them.  Maybe, if you put an image called "<imgname>.bmp" there, and call "./0all <imgname>", it will work.

If you run into problems, please mail pclark@cs.bris.ac.uk with a copy of your terminal's error output (the whole history if possible!).
