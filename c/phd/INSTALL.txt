You are recommended to follow the following procedure to obtain a working copy of my research code.

Visit http://hwi.ath.cx/twiki/bin/view/Neuralyte/ProjectJsh and install and run the jsh environment.

In jsh, type:

	cd $JPATH/code
	hwicvs co c/phd c/joeylib
	makephdbins

If all goes well, you will have compiled all the executables I used for testing.

Running the programs may be a little harder!  I used to have some test images in the images/ directory, and I ran 0allall to batch process them.

If you run into problems, please mail joey@hwi.ath.cx with a copy of the error output on your terminal.
