f(x)=u*(1+v*(((u-x)/(w*x-u*v)-0.5)+1))/(1+w*(((u-x)/(w*x-u*v)-0.5)+1))-u*(1+v*((u-x)/(w*x-u*v)-0.5))/(1+w*((u-x)/(w*x-u*v)-0.5))

# This is an estimate of the real eqn, but more likely to converge because less complicated!
# x=(u-y)/(w*y-u*v)
# f(x)=u*v/(1+x*w)
# f(y)=u*v/(1+w*(u-y)/(w*y-u*v))
# it gives rubbish results

# u=0.001
v=-20
w=0.00001
