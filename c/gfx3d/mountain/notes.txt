In real geology:

Different types of rock form different shapes:
hard rock, jagged mountain
soft soil, rolling hills formed by rain erosion

Flat plains are formed undersea by sediment and appear on a rising plate

Mountain ranges form where plates meet

Coastal erosion forms cliffs

Depending on formation of different types of rock, soft rock can wash away
to leave interesting shapes in hard rock.
