 File format for input 
-+-----------------------------+
'
The input file has three parts ::

   o Rate definitions
   o Agent definitions
   o A composotition

 -> Rates

Format 

   %rate_name=value;

These should come at the top of the file.
Symbolic rates that you want to use later
should be defined here.

 -> Agents

Format

   #agent_name = (action,rate,message).AGENT1 + AGENT2;

Where message is optional, rate is previously defined
and AGENT1 and AGENT2 are either defined already, or
are later to be defined. '.' and '+' are the only
operators currently supported.

Messages are currently dealt with as plain text, i.e. not
properly supported.

 -> Composition

  agnet ( "||" agent)*

Named cooperation sets are not yet supported.
