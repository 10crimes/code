TODO:

Need to be able to drop objects onto Arguments.
What sort of component should the Object Arguments be?
We really want to be able to include (load or preferable pre-load) external jars.

Support for setters and getters (eg. get()/accessor properties can be displayed automatically)

Different icon for each class type (can of course default to parent if no icon specified for that class)!

Before further progress, let us not forget that certain statics may need to be accessed, eg. from abstract classes.
We have still left some bits of Java hidden from us.

On the other hand, the current state of the software is more appropriate for a simplified "functional Java", so maybe further expansion will just complicate the project.  (In "functional Java", Java nasties could be hidden behind more appropriate functional wrappers.)


DONE:
Menu's are now nicely split and ordered alphabetically.
However in the method listings, they should be arranged by the method name field (not the return type).
I will now solve this by putting return type at the end!
