TODO:
Need to be able to drop objects onto Arguments.
What sort of component should the Object Arguments be?

DONE:
Menu's are now nicely split and ordered alphabetically.
However in the method listings, they should be arranged by the method name field (not the return type).
I will now solve this by putting return type at the end!
