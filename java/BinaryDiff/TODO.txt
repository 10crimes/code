Have the expander produce multiple files (the same ones that were archived!)
Provide useful options to command-line, especially desirable is -o -
Likewise, expander should be able to accept input from stdin.
Trim down all unwanted code
Find and fix the goddam memory-leak
Add a test-expansion-against-files option to verify the archive contents.
Release? ^^

Produce more informative output (e.g. compression ratio of current file)
BUG: after 63% it started counting down from -62% :o

Memory cost:
past data for real checking
hashmap of past data's checksums for fast checking
Allow user to set size of both caches
Split caches into recent data vs. most reused (useful) data
Allow user to set ratio of recent/reused
This will require more complex storage...

Consider: is it possible/desirable to create 3 files? reused data, non-reused data, reuse links (what is reused where)  Would probably require some late-writing, but too late, i.e. mem problem?

Since BinaryDiff is still alpha, make --verify_after the default, and allow option to switch it off



Consider:
if we find a small word which matches, and find all matches for it in the file, we can mark off the endpoints of all these matches.
When searching for new matches, we can avoid all window-scans which whose boundaries cross the endpoints.  Not always optimal, but sometimes better?
