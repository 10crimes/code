If we are planning to use the torrent network, we should also share our
distributed data over it.

Someone must compile a monthly database torrent release.

People get it, and it also has the latest software.

It should preserve privacy ofc.

It could be crazy encrypted.  So like you have to have a key (data from
original .torrent files) in order to unlock the database!
