UltimateBrowser (which we may implement as a proxy) includes functions such as:

Foldable tree on the top-left, showing session history movement.  Allow return to previous pages.

Links in a page (e.g. 1 on 20 google results) can be opened in-page with a fold-out panel of some kind?  (If neccessary, we could fake this, by going to the target page, then adding our old results page "around the outside of it"! O_o)

If user wants to regularly view a certain page or site with certain processing applied, or a page sources from other resources, he should
create a Nugget, and use it.  That keeps it separate from the actual website.  Makes Nuggets adaptable and expandable.





Read-ahead caching is a bit too much.  But if we detect that the user is often
clicking a certain thing (e.g. the Next button), then we can do targetted
read-ahead caching.  :)








IDEAS

Edit your own page
Like netvibes
Except you build up your own jumpgate (homepage), then save it and take it away with you.
Make it a file://, for much faster loading.
Users will still come back to us, to edit their jumpgate!
