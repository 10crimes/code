When browsing http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/solaris/java.html in Konqueror
Firefox will refuse to load the data.  "unterminated string literal"


FIXED by trimTopLine(): There is a bug appearing on Hwi's Wiki which happens on a few other sites also.
  Somehow CSS tag in the HTML *and* requests to grimeape for userscripts, are requesting <host>http/... instead of <host>/...


FIXED by improving uneval(): Browsing my webserver's cgi folders breaks track_history uneval on Konqueror: http://hwi.ath.cx/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/other/gm_scripts/

the GM icon is not loading because konq puts the /_gRiMeApE_/ in the middle, not at the start!
Oh maybe not.  I think it's javascript injected by WebArchive which is changing the image's href!


If track_history is run before Delicious_Search_Results_On_Google, then the latter fails in Konq, with parse error :o
