If we visit http://hwi.ath.cx/hwikalong, in Konq or FF, the GA scripts are not being run.
Mmm that's actually the page's fault - the badly-formed bookmarklets break the HTM
 parsing, so our injected script tags aren't seen.
 A solution for such broken pages, would be to inject at the start of the document
 (before any HTML errors can appear), but still wait for page load event before
 loading our userscripts.

Appears page has no problems now:
When browsing http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/solaris/java.html in Konqueror
Firefox will refuse to load the data.  "unterminated string literal"


FIXED by tidyTopLine(): There is a bug appearing on Hwi's Wiki which happens on a few other sites also.
  Somehow CSS tag in the HTML *and* requests to grimeape for userscripts, are requesting <host>http/... instead of <host>/...


FIXED by improving uneval(): Browsing my webserver's cgi folders breaks track_history uneval on Konqueror: http://hwi.ath.cx/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/other/gm_scripts/


http://web.archive.org/web/20070123042959/http://www.dunck.us/collab/GreaseMonkeyUserScripts#head-68cca0b4cd20c940c1410bb1ccc58e403dc42d06
the GM icon is not loading because konq puts the /_gRiMeApE_/ in the middle, not at the start!
Oh maybe not.  I think it's javascript injected by WebArchive which is changing the image's href!


If track_history is run before Delicious_Search_Results_On_Google, then the latter fails in Konq, with parse error :o


On wikipedia, the POST for Preview edits was never returning from the server.
Our client requested "Connection: close" but we requested "keep-alive" from the server, which is likely to be the cause.
But are keep-alive POSTs impossible?  If not, what is wrong with ours?  We do send Content-Length.

The WayBackArchive's Javascript does not play nicely with GrimeApe.  Actually it will sometimes happily load and run the userscripts, but then the icon URL gets changed and for some reason the config gets reset to default.



Multi-frame pages which cause problems:
